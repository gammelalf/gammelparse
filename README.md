# gammelparse

I love argparse and have used it for a long time.

For [a project](https://github.com/CrsiX/MateBot) I had to look at its code and try understanding it in order to tweak it.
What I saw, was a mess of weird ways of solving problems and outdated or missing docstrings and comments.
Also navigating through the huge single file is annoying.

So I decided to clean it and maybe add features in the future.

## What it is / does

It uses the same interface as argparse but the code behind it is _- in my opinion -_ more elegant and readable

## Requirements

`python 3.6` because I love [_f-strings_](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498) and they are generally more readable than old `%` or `str.format`
formatting.
